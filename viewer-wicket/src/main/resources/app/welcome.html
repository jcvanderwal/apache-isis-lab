<p class="intro">
This sample webapp was generated by the Isis QuickStart archetype, configured to use Isis' wicket viewer.
</p>

<br/>
<p>
By default the domain objects are persisted using JDO/DataNucleus objectstore, configured to persist to an in-memory HSQL/DB database.
</p>

<br/>
<p>
To change the JDBC connection string, edit <tt>WEB-INF/persistor_datanucleus.properties</tt>.  Also update the <tt>pom.xml</tt> for the appropriate JDBC driver.
</p>

<br/>
<p>
To change the objectstore implementation, edit the <tt>WEB-INF/isis.properties</tt> file.
</p>

<br/>
<p>
The wicket viewer initially is configured using Wicket's 'development' mode, with Isis' authorization modules are disabled.
For deployment, typically Wicket viewer should be switched to 'deployment' mode, by editing <tt>WEB-INF/web.xml</tt>.  
Isis' authorization should also be enabled (again, by editing the <tt>WEB-INF/isis.properties</tt> config file).
